    <h2>Thoughts Before the Project</h2>
    <p>The first step I took after thinking about an idea was how to execute it.
    I thought of making an info page, but I didn't know how so I decided to use "select" to make a list of dates just in case people didn't know the exact dates to type in if I used a search bar.
    I started researching by finding out Mario's highest selling point. 
    I mostly used a sebsite that stated Mario's highest selling points and based it off that.
    I also took note of
    </p>
    
    <h2>Step 1- Research and Select Tag</h2>
    <p>The select bar had to have differnet sections, or years, to indicate the major evolutions of Mario. 
    At the end, I kinda cheated a little and just searched up "Evolutions of Mario" though.
    I used a select tag with an id of "Mdate" to mark down the dates, separating the years where Mario evolved. 
    I also changed the size of the button to a width of 200 to make clicking the button easier.
    These steps were taken to make the select tag only. 
    It should look like this after you make a select tag...
    </p>
    
    <img class="picture" src="select example.png" width="1300">
    
    <h2>Step 2- Button Tag</h2>
    <p>The next step involves making a button with an id of "searchB" that triggers an action and corresponds to whichever year selected. 
    To start, I made a button tag with the words "search" on it. 
    This step is fairly simple, and you can customize the button however way you like it to.
    After making a button, it should look like this...</p>
    
    <img class="picture" src="button example.png" width="1300">
    
    <h2>Step 3- Header and Div Tag</h2>
    <p>The last step in setting up the page involves making a title for the page and making a div named "infoS" that makes space for text to appear after tweaking with the Javascript.
    After setting up in the HTML, it should look like this...
    </p>
    
    <img class="picture" src="div example.png" width="1300">
    
    <h2>Step 4- Transfering Tariables</h2>
    <p> Transfering variables is fairly easy. Start by writing var in the JS followed by the name of your div in HTML.
    Next, add "document.getElementById" which would find and bring the div from HTML to JS. 
    Follow the "document.getElementById" with (name of you variable in HTML).
    Now, all of your divs are transfered to JS.

    <h2>Step 5- Event Listener</h2>
    <p>The next step inolves putting the tags and variables to good use. 
    I took the button's variable and added ".addEventListener("click", function)" after. Now, the action will trigger after the button is clicked.
    I added if statements corresponding to the number of options in the select tag. For me, I added 5. 
    My first if statement looked like this...
