    <h3>Thoughts Before the Project</h3>
    <p>The first step I took after thinking about an idea was how to execute it.
    I thought of making an info page, but I didn't know how so I decided to use "select" to make a list of dates just in case people didn't know the exact dates to type in if I used a search bar.
    I started researching by finding out Mario's highest selling point. 
    I mostly used a sebsite that stated Mario's highest selling points and based it off that.
    I also took note of
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 1, Research and Select Tag</h3>
    <p>The select bar had to have differnet sections, or years, to indicate the major evolutions of Mario. 
    At the end, I kinda cheated a little and just searched up "Evolutions of Mario" though.
    I used a select tag to mark down the dates, separating the years where Mario evolved. 
    I also changed the size of the button to a width of 200 to make clicking the button easier.
    These steps were taken to make the select tag only. 
    It should look like this after you make a select tag...

    <h3>Step 2, Button Tag</h3>
    <p>The next step involves making a button that triggers an action and corresponds to whichever year selected. 
    To start, I made a button tag with the words "search" on it. 
    This step is fairly simple, and you can customize the button however way you like it to.
    After making a button, it should look like this...</p>
    
    <img class="picture" src="button example.png" width="700">
    
    <h3>Step 3, Header and Div Tag</h3>
    <p>The last step in setting up the page involves making a title for the page and making a div that makes space for text to appear after tweaking with the Javascript.
    After setting up in the HTML, it should look like this...
