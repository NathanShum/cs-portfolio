            <br>
            
            <li><h3>&lt;p&gt; tags are used to write paragraphs in your body.</h3></li>
              
            <li><h3>&lt;h1,2,3,4,5,6&gt; tags are used to change the font size of your words.I used this more than the paragraph tag because they provided more varitey than what a p tag does. I put titles as a bigger size and descriptions as a smaller font.</h3></li>
              
            <li><h3>&lt;table&gt; tags are used to make tables for making a schedule or organizing words.</h3></li>
              
            <li><h3>&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; are used to make lists and order items with numbers or bullet points. I used this to list some of my hobbies. I put this in the top of my About Me page as kind of a table of contents and a general guid of what will be on that page of info.</h3></li>
            
            <li><h3>&lt;img&gt;tags are used to insert an image. The images I put on my About Me page represent what most of my favorite hobbies look like.</h3></li>
            
            <li><h3>&lt;br&gt; tags skip a line. I used this to make sure my About Me page doesn't look too cramped and I also used it to divide my hobbies as an organization tool.</h3></li>
              
            <li><h3>width="?" can also be used to change the size of the picture you just inserted. I used this to resize my images to hopefully make them look more proportional. </h3></li>
            
            <li><h3>&lt;href&gt; tags are used to insert a link to a website.</h3></li>
            
            <li><h3>A CSS can be linked to a HTML by using &lt;link rel=&quot;?&quot; href=&quot;?&quot; type=&quot;?&quot; /&gt;. CSS are used to change the color of words and background, align text, add borders, etc. I linked my About Me page to a CSS to change colors and add borders to my pictures. I also used CSS on this page to put Halloween colors on it.</h3></li>
            
            <li><h3>&lt;em&gt; tags are used to italicise words. This tag is used to emphasize words or phrases that are important to my page.</h3></li>
             
            <li><h3>&lt;strong&gt; tags bold the words inside the tags. This tag is similar to the italicizing tag in the sense that it is used to put an amphasis to something.</h3></li>
             
            <li><h3>&lt;style&gt; can be used to change colors and borders kinda like CSS.</h3></li>
            
            <li><h3>&lt;div&gt; tags seperate wors and pictures to make changing styles in CSS easier. In my About Me page, I used this to put pictures side by side to organize them more. It makes it so that the description I put under the pictures are organized well. </h3></li>
            
            <li><h3>&lt;a href=&quot;?&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/a&gt; allows you to include a navbar in your page as long as the page is linked to a navbar CSS. I had the navbar linked to both of my pages to make transfering between the pages easier.</h3></li>
            
            <li><h3> Class="?" can be used to give a code a "nickname" which allows you to also use the classname in CSS for changing colors, adding borders, aligning words, etc.<br> id="?" is like a lcass, except it only can be applied once.<br> In a CSS, a .? { } is needed to change class tags and #? { } is needed for id tags.</h3></li>
            
            <li><h3>On the CSS, img { border-style: inset;} can be used to make it so that the image looks more into the background.<br> Text-align:?; can align your words to a side of the page.<br> Bakcground-color:?; and color:?; changes the colors of your HTML.<br> Border:?; adds a border and margin:?; separates text and pictures. On the About Me page, I added borders to picutures to distinguish the colors of the background and the colors of the picture to make it easier to see.</h3></li>
            
            <li><h3>The navbar can be made by &lt;a href=&quot;(whatever page you want your navbar to take you to)&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;(what words will show on your navbar)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.<br> To change the way your navbar looks like, you can link the CSS for your navbar to your HTML.</h3></li>
